## Cognitive Skills & Student Performance Dashboard

End-to-end project combining synthetic data generation, analysis (EDA + ML + clustering), and a modern Next.js dashboard to explore student cognitive skills and performance.

### Folder Structure
- `notebooks/analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for dataset creation, EDA, ML model, clustering, and export to the dashboard.
- `dashboard/`: Next.js app (TailwindCSS + Recharts + shadcn/ui-style components) that visualizes metrics, charts, personas, and a searchable/sortable student table.
- `dashboard/public/students.json`: Exported dataset for the dashboard.
- `students.csv`: Raw CSV generated by the notebook.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- Git

### 1) Python Setup
```bash
python -m venv .venv
./.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1  # Windows PowerShell
pip install -U pip
pip install -r notebooks/requirements.txt
```

### 2) Run the Notebook
```bash
jupyter lab  # or: jupyter notebook
```
Open `notebooks/analysis.ipynb` and run all cells. This will:
- Generate a synthetic dataset (~200 students) with unique `student_id` and realistic variation.
- Perform EDA (summary stats, distributions, correlations, scatter plots).
- Train a model (RandomForest by default) and evaluate (MAE, RMSE, RÂ²), with feature importances.
- Cluster learning personas with KMeans and visualize with PCA.
- Export `students.csv` and `dashboard/public/students.json` for the dashboard.

### 3) Next.js Dashboard Setup
Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
Set-Location -Path "dashboard"
npm install --no-fund --no-audit
npx --yes next dev
```

macOS/Linux:
```bash
cd dashboard
npm install --no-fund --no-audit
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

The dashboard includes:
- Overview cards (average assessment score, skills, and engagement time)
- Charts (Bar: average skills vs score; Scatter: attention vs score with regression line; Radar: per-student profile)
- Students table (searchable, sortable, with persona tags)
- Insights section (auto-generated highlights)

### 4) Deploy on Vercel
1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. Import the repo on Vercel.
3. Set framework to Next.js. No special build commands needed (`npm run build`).
4. Deploy. Ensure `dashboard/` is the project root if you deploy the dashboard as a separate project; otherwise, set the monorepo root and choose `dashboard` as the project path on Vercel.

### Key Findings (from the default synthetic data)
- Focus and retention have strong positive correlation with `assessment_score`.
- Attention moderately correlates with performance; engagement time shows diminishing returns.
- The model attributes highest importance to focus/retention features.
- Personas typically include:
  - High Achievers (high skills, high score)
  - Consistent Engagers (steady skills, strong engagement)
  - Distracted Learners (lower attention/focus)
  - Under-engaged (low engagement_time despite potential)

These will change with new synthetic seeds or real data.

### Notes
- A pre-generated `dashboard/public/students.json` is included so the dashboard runs immediately. Re-run the notebook to regenerate with new data.
- Every student has a globally unique numeric `student_id`.

### Troubleshooting
- "'next' is not recognized":
  - Ensure dependencies installed in `dashboard/`: `npm install`.
  - Run with local binary: `npx --yes next dev` (PowerShell/macOS/Linux).
  - If the error persists, remove `node_modules` and lockfile in `dashboard/` then reinstall:
    - PowerShell: `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\node_modules; Remove-Item -Force .\package-lock.json; npm install`
    - macOS/Linux: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`
- OneDrive path issues (file locks/ENOTEMPTY on Windows):
  - Close editors/explorer windows that may lock files.
  - Retry a clean install as above.
  - If problems persist, move the project outside OneDrive (e.g., `C:\Projects`).
- Execution policy (PowerShell): if scripts are blocked, run PowerShell as Administrator and execute: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned`.
- Node version: use Node 18+ (LTS recommended). Check with `node -v`.
